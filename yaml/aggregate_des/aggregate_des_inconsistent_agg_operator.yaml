  severity: WARNING
  introduction: >
    Data elements which are not numeric (text, dates, etc) should have an aggregation
    operator set to NONE.
  recommendation: >
    Open the affected data elements in the Maintenance App and change their aggregation type
    to NONE. Alternatively, these can be altered via the API.
