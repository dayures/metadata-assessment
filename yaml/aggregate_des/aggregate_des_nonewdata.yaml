  severity: WARNING
  introduction: >
    Data elements with no recent data values are likely to fall into one of two
    categories: 1) they have been used previously and hold useful/relevant data, 2)
    they have not been used in any meaningful way (e.g. data values stem from testing
    during configuration or a small pilot) and the data is not useful/relevant.
  recommendation: >
    If the data elements hold useful historical data, they should be kept. Consider
    renaming the data elements and/or data sets to make it clear they are not used
    for data collection any more. Data elements which are not actively used and have
    no valueable data associated.
