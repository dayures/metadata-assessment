  severity: WARNING
  introduction: >
    All dashboards should be reviewed routinely. Dashboards that are no longer viewed 
    routinely are not being used, or potentially being used incorrectly. The definition of
    "routine" may vary between implementations and therefore you can assess this over both 
    the last 12 months (default) as well as a pre-defined period of your choosing.
  recommendation: >
    Dashboards that should be reviewed routinely and are not point to a broader data use
    issue that will not be addressed by technical means. Such dashboards may need to be 
    kept while a process for reviewing them more frequently becomes more well defined. Such
    unused dashboards may also be, for example, private dashboards for users who are no 
    longer active.
