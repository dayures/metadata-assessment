  severity: WARNING
  introduction: >
    Categories with the exact same category options should be considered
    to be merged. Categoriesw with the exact same category options
    may be easily confused by users in analysis.
  recommendation: |
    If category combinations have already been created with duplicative categories,
    it is recommended that you do not take any action, but rather ensure
    that users understand that there may be two categories which are duplicative.

    If one of the categories is not in use in any category combination, it should
    consider to be removed from the system.
