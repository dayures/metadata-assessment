  severity: WARNING
  introduction: >
    All indicators that are calculated should be used to produce some type of analysis 
    output (charts, maps, tables), alternatively to provide feedback during data entry
    by being part of a data set.
  recommendation: >
    Indicators that are not routinely being reviewed in analysis, either in an output or 
    data set, should be reviewed to determine if they still need to be calculated.
    If these are meant to be used for routine review, then associated outputs should be 
    created using them. If these indicators are not going to be used for any type of
    information review, consideration should be made to either archive them or delete them.
